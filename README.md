# Drawing Game in Unity

## Project 1:
This is a Unity application that allows users to draw a variety of 3D shapes on a canvas. The user can draw using different colors, and change the size of the shapes as they draw. To draw, they can drag the mouse while holding left click, and a 3D shape will be spawned at their current mouse position. Users also have the ability to randomize the shapes, color, and size. To make erasing user-friendly, the user can simply enter and exit erase mode using right click. 

### Features:
- Display Mouse Position
- Create Game Object
- Change Game Object
- Change Color
- Change scale factor
- Clear canvas

## Project 2:
For project 2, five new features were added. One feature allows the user to change the rotation of the shapes they draw via 3 input fields. One input field is used to set the rotation around the x-axis, one for the y-axis, and one for the z-axis. Another feature is a toggle that when checked will allow the user to randomize the rotation for all axes for the shapes drawn. The next feature allows the user to change the background of the canvas via dropdown menu. The user has 3 options to choose from, default white, black, and sky blue. The next feature allows the user to change the erase size while erasing shapes using a slider. The last feature is one that allows the user to change the background based on the current time. If the current time is morning, the background will be set to a random light color. If the current time is afternoon, the background will be set to a random warm color. If the current time is in the evening, the background will be set to a random color darker than that of the one for afternoon. If the current time is at night, the background will be set to a random dark color.

The last feature allows the user to change the animation speed to make the animation for the prefabs faster or slower using a slider.
